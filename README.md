# Insufficient Error Handling in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling in asynchronous operations. The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from a remote API. However, the error handling is inadequate for effective debugging. The `catch` block simply prints the error and rethrows, losing context and specific error details.

## Bug
The primary issue is the lack of specific error handling. The `catch` block catches all exceptions (`catch (e)`), making pinpointing the exact problem difficult.  Additional information, such as the type of exception and the stack trace, would greatly assist in debugging.

## Solution
The solution involves more robust error handling.  Instead of a generic `catch` block, we catch specific exceptions (e.g., `FormatException` for JSON decoding errors, `SocketException` for network issues). We then provide more detailed logging, potentially including stack traces. This allows for precise identification and remediation of errors.
